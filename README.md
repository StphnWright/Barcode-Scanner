Programming Project P8.6 in *Big Java*.

(Note that a snapshot of this problem has been included in the files p8.6-1.png and p8.6.2.png)

This we I have provided a single template only, `ZipTest.java`. Your code *must* work with the ZipTest class I have provided. This means that you will need to create your own Zipcode class with the interface *implied* by ZipTest.java

In addition to the source files for your programs include a single text file in your codio workspace named readMe.txt with an explanation of what you did for each programming problem. That is, write in plain English, instructions for using your software, explanations for how and why you chose to design your code the way you did. The readMe.txt file is also an opportunity for you to get partial credit when certain requirements of the assignment are not met.
